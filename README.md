# Better Developer Community Project

For those in the Better Developer community looking to get accustomed with using Git and working as part of a team, which is a vital skill for software developers of all levels.

## What This Is

As stated above this is our very own little playground to get to grips with using Git, things like Branching, Merging, Pull Requests and more, if this is all new to you then don't worry, there is a **Resources** section below where you can learn more.

## What This Isn't

OK, so obviously when we first think of a community project we all think that we are going to be part of something big, creating something awesome, I'm here to tell you **This isn't that** We are not going to be building some super cool face recognition, self driving spaceship thingy...

However all is not lost, we will be learning a great skill that will set you apart from the competition when looking for a job and more importantly the skills that will mean you can do your job effectively and not f\*\*k everything up for your team.

## Resources

I'm guessing that most of us will have the basics down, but it is always nice to have thing at hand to help out, so below are a couple of resources for using git, cheat sheet kinda things and then a link or two about git workflow in general.

[Atlassian Git CheatSheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) - nice and organised with all the commands you need

[OH SHIT GIT](https://ohshitgit.com/) - nice lighthearted cheat sheet, but great for when things (inevitably) go wrong.

Another great read from our very own Corey can be found [here](http://www.bttrdvlpr.com/version-control/)

## Contributing

All members of the Better Developer community are encouraged t get involved regardless of skill level, if you know all there is to know (you don't...) then get involved and help others, if you have never used git before then **START NOW**.

First up is to make your first pull request, I'll give a brief walkthrough here, but I want to stay away from listing the exact commands and let you find that out for yourself using the resources above, of course if you are stuck reach out in the Discord.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new branch, using your name as the branch name.
3. Add your name and GitHub url to the **CONTRIBUTORS.md** file.
4. Push your changes to your branch.
5. Go to your repository and you'll see a green button **Compare & pull request** - click it.
6. Sit back and wait for your pull request to be merged.

## Future Plans

More information about the plans for the project can be found in the _community-project_ chanel on Discord.
